      <h2 className="sub-heading">What is Whale Watching?</h2>

      <p className="body-text">
        It's exactly what it sounds like! Whale watching is the practice of
        observing whales and orcas in their natural habitat. There are lots of
        different reasons to go whale watching: scientific research, educational
        purposes or just for fun! Anyone can go whale watching. This site will
        help answer some questions you might have and give you some information
        on how you can get started and get involved.
      </p>

      <p className="body-text">
        An estimated 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008 and
        the numbers are growing. Responsible whale watching has benefitted
        conservation efforts through education and raising awareness of the
        challenges that whales and orcas currently face. Many species of whales
        and orcas are currently listed as endangered. The responsibility lies
        with us, together we can help change and stop harmful practices that
        negatively impact the whale and orca populations.
