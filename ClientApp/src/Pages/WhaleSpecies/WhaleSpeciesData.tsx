    text: "The name “blue whale” comes from the fact that when this whale is submerged underwater it appears to be a purely blue color. What makes this whale so popular is its extremely large size. This massive whale is the largest living animal in existence growing to lengths in excess of 100 ft! These whales can be found traveling throughout all of the worlds major oceans.",

    text: "Humpback whales are well-known for their majestic whale sounds which are often referred to as whale songs. These songs are strikingly similar to music composed by humans and can be heard many miles away.One of the things that fascinate scientists about this species is how they can be found singing in harmony together, even when separated by great distances. Aside from their beautiful harmonic sounds they are also known for their acrobatic nature. These whales are able to spy hop and continuously leaping out of the water despite their large size.",

    text: "The sperm whale is the largest of the toothed whale species growing to lengths of up to 67 ft. This whale gets its name from the spermaceti organ located in its head. At first it was believed that this organ was responsible for producing sperm due to the oil it secreted which very much resembles the appearance of sperm, but scientists discovered that this is not the case. Unfortunately they are still unsure of what this organ is responsible for however scientists have hypothesized that the oil may play a role in helping the whale adjust its buoyancy in the water so that it can dive and rise more effectively.",
